# Project-3-CS210-
What did you do particularly well?
	One thing I really nailed was putting together the program with a clear structure and modular design. By setting up a separate GroceryTracker class in both the header and implementation files, I was able to keep the main program focused on user interactions while letting the class methods handle data management and file processing. This clear division of responsibilities made the code much easier to understand and maintain. I also made sure to include proper input validation for the menu options, which helps avoid crashes or weird behavior from bad user input. Also, incorporating case-insensitive searches and trimming inputs boost efficiency and makes it easier for users. All in all, the layout and user-friendly interface make the program easy to use and dependable.
  
Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient and secure?
	One way to improve things would be to enhance data storage and error handling. Right now, the program pulls data from a plain text file every time it runs, but if we added features to save processed data or manage missing files better, it would be a lot more reliable. To enhance performance and scalability, utilizing more sophisticated data structures or file formats, like JSON or CSV parsing libraries, could speed up data handling and increase security by minimizing the risk of malformed input errors. 

Which pieces of the code did you find challenging, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your network?
	The toughest part of the project was handling the file input and accurately mapping item frequencies. Making sure each item's name was read correctly and counted right took a lot of attention to detail, especially when dealing with file streams and the std::map structure. I tackled these issues by testing the program with various input files and using debugging outputs to confirm that the map was saving data as it should. I also used online resources such as C++ reference docs and course examples to get a better grip on stream operations and container manipulation, which have now become a part of my ongoing support network.


  What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work? How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
	Some of the skills I gained from this project, like data management, class design, and validating user input are very transferable to future coding tasks and real-life applications. I focused on making the code readable by using clear variable names, consistent indentation, and inline comments that clarify what each code block does. The modular setup, which clearly separates the main menu logic from the GroceryTracker class, allows the program to be easily adapted for future features like data exporting or adding a graphical interface. These design choices help make the program simpler to maintain, expand, and debug, which are crucial practices for professional software development.
